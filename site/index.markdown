My name is Esteban and I am a music producer with extensive experience in the games industry that spans for over a decade.

I used to work as a programmer and game designer and have more than 15 projects completed including big names like Kingdom Rush and Iron Marines while working at Ironhide Game Studio and also as an independent creator in the indie and mobile games ecosystem. 

Now fully immersed in the space of music production from my personal studio, I take a creativity-centered approach to every project I embark upon.
